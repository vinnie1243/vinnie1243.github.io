                <h2>Collision</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    There are 2 ways that 3d games can do collision the first one is by useing a hitbox. This works by making a box 
                    around an object and checking to see if any of the other objects hitbox is inside the hitbox of that obj and then 
                    moving it out of that object. The other way of doing it is by using the triangles that the whole world is made of the
                     reason that games rarely use this options is becasue it is extremely performance heavy and will cause the game to be extremly laggy.

                <h2>Movement</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    3d games typically do movement by giving each object that can move a velocity vector and then they have a function that will use that 
                    vector to move the object based on its speed and direction and they will also have the object slow down usually in mid air so it will
                     not go on forever.

                <h2>Gravity/Boyancy</h2>
                <p>
                    The way games do gravity is not very complicated they basically just subtract from an objects y velocity every frame 
                    and then they use collision to stop them from falling through the floor. And the way they do boyancy in games is a 
                    little more complicated but not by much. What games will do is assign an object a bouancy and then they will use a 
                    vector that points straight out of the water to start moving the player in that direction if their boyancy is greater
                     than the gravity also being applied at the same time.
