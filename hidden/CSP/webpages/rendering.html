                <h2>Triangles</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In 3d games Triangles are used to create everything you see on the screen. From a barrel to your own character but 
                    the reason they do this is very interesting. The reason they use triangles is because they are the simplest 2d shape 
                    and they also can make anyother shape. This is useful for 3d rendering because it lets programmers not have to do a 
                    buch of math to figure what shapes they need to fill in something. And the reason they dont do that is becasue it 
                    would use a lot more proccessing power.

                <h2>Projection</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Projection is the process of taking a 3d object and turning it into a 2d object. This is done by using a camera 
                    and a projection matrix. The camera is used to see the object and the projection matrix is used to turn the 3d 
                    object into a 2d object. This is done by taking the 3d object and multiplying it by the projection matrix. This 
                    will give you a 2d object that you can display on the screen.

                <h2>Clipping</h2>
                <p>
                    Clipping is where the triangles are cut off when they hit the edge of the screen or get to close or behind the camera.
                    The reason they do this is for performance and because they do this they can render far higher quality things.
                    Another reason why they do this is because when triangles get really close to the screen they get really large and can ask
                    to draw billions or even trillions of pixels and this will cause the application to crash.
