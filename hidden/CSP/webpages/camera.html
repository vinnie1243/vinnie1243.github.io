                <h2>Movement</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In 3d games movement can work in one of two ways the player can be the one moving around like in real life or the world
                    can move around making it look like the player is moving but they actually arent. The way most games do movement of the
                    camera/player is by moving the camera. The reason they do it that way is because it is a lot more performace friendly 
                    becuase they dont have to do math all the time to offset the triangles based on how the player has moved

                <h2>Rotation</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Rotation in 3d games is very complicated but an over simplicfication is they use a matrix to rotate the triangles
                     based on the roll yaw and pitch of the camera and then they make the camera look in the direction the roll yaw and 
                     pitch have it facing

                <h2>Lighting</h2>
                <p> 
                    Lighting in 3d games is done in one of two ways. The first way and the way most games do it is by having little light
                     sources all over the place and then creating shadows based on if something is blocking them. The other way games do 
                     lighting is by have light just come out of the camera.
